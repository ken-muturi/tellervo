This directory holds scripts that can be run from Corina.  Currently,
only Python scripts (*.py) are supported, but hopefully Scheme (*.scm)
will be supported in the near future.

Also, scripts only appear in the main menubar, not editor menubars, so
they can't operate on "this sample", you have to prompt the user for all
input files.

Export Ranges:
	Loads a master, and exports it as lines of "element start end".
Good for making bargraphs in your favorite spreadsheet.

Export to Spreadsheet:
	Loads a master, and exports the data of each elemnt in columns.
Good for making graphs, or doing pretty much anything else, in your
favorite spreadsheet.

Index many files:
	Given a bunch of files, index all of them.  An exponential curve
is always used, the filename extensions are changed to ".ind", and the
title has "(indexed)" added to it.

Split into Early-Late:
	If a sample was measured as early-late-early-late-..., create 2
samples from it, one with the earlywood measurements (1, 3, 5, ...), and
one with the latewood measurements (2, 4, 6, ...).
