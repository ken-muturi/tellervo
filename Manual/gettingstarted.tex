Corina is the tree ring measuring and analysis program developed at the Cornell Tree-Ring Laboratory. It is focused primarily on the measurement of tree ring widths and the organization and curation of the data, metadata and physical samples. It is cross-platform (running on all Java 6 enabled operating systems including Windows, MacOSX and Linux) and open-source. It includes support for Velmex, Lintab and Bannister measuring platforms.

Corina has been developed since 2000 as a desktop Java application. Earlier iterations (version 0.x and 1.x) were built around a standard file-based data management system. In 2007, work began on a major rewrite of the software whereby this file-based data management was replaced with a true relational database and server/client webservice infrastructure. This series of releases (versions 2.x) are what are described in this manual.
