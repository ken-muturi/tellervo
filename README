----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is not a final release.  It still has many limitations and bugs.
You are encouraged to use it and report bugs and feature requests.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION

There is no install program yet.  Simply copy the Corina directory to
your disk.  To make it easier to run, you can make a shortcut in a
convenient place.  On Windows, right-click, copy, right-click, paste
shortcut.  Which icon to copy?  See below.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

RUNNING

To run Corina:

  - in Windows 95, double-click Corina.bat

  - in Windows 98/2000, double-click Corina.jar (if this fails, you
can use Corina.bat)

  - on Mac OS X, there's no double-clickable icon (yet), but you can
either double-click the Corina.jar file (in the Corina folder), or
type "ant run" from a terminal window.  (Double-clicking Corina.jar
won't get you hardware acceleration, a dock icon, or the "Corina" name
in the menubar.)

   - on Unix, type "ant run".

Corina has been tested -- to varying degrees -- on Windows 2000, Linux
2.4, and Mac OS X, with Java 1.3.
