This document describes how to use log4j for logging in Corina.
(You need to link in log4j, and add it to the libraries, javadoc,
etc.)  I tried using it, but never got it to work very well.

Another alternative is to use the java.util.logging package.  I get
the feeling that this isn't quite as well-designed as log4j, and isn't
as widely used (partly because it's not as old), but it has the
advantage that it ships with every 1.4 implementation (and I'll be
targetting only 1.4 soon) - no need to download and link in log4j.jar,
and worry about things like getting Javadoc to find it.  In fact,
that's such a big advantage, unless I find java.util.logging to be
completely inadequate, I should use that.  (The rest of this document
is provided for completeness, now.)

import org.apache.log4j.Logger; // BUG: javadoc can't find this! (why not?)

	/*
	  to use this, set the properties:
	  -- log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG,A1
	  -- log4j.appender.A1.Threshold=DEBUG
	  -- log4j.appender.A1=org.apache.log4j.FileAppender
	  -- log4j.appender.A1.File=corina.log
	  -- log4j.appender.corina.Metadata=DEBUG,A1
	  but even those don't seem to make this work.  what am i missing?
	*/
	Logger log = Logger.getLogger("corina.Metadata");
	log.info("in metadata template init");

(This code comes from corina.Metadata, but was never really used.)
