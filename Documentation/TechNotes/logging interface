LogEntry = {
	time
	logger (corina subsystem, like "database")
	level (warning, info, etc.)
	message
}

need a log appender, which stores "LogEntry"s
	button?: Clear
	button: Save...
	button?: Print...
	popup: level (warning, info, etc.)
	(display only?  need to set logging level?  by subsystem?)

need a log window, which shows LogEntrys as rows

Log = {list of LogEntry} can be saved to disk as text (or HTML?)

prefs:
-- "keep logs for {1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks}"

save automatically?
-- otherwise, not much use if user quits
-- where to save?
-- need to cycle automatically
-- only save for 1 week
-- in ~/.corina/logs/<date>
-- one log file per day
-- (if corina started a second time, append to original file)
-- need to be able to load-from-file, then, too

rdbms?
-- log to database?
-- easier for admins, harder for users
-- what if the database fails?  files can almost never fail.
-- add "name" column to database; possibly also "IP"

log4j or java.util.logging?
-- how hard is it to port between them?
