The stuff in Manual/HTML/*.html validates as "HTML 4.01 Transitional"
if you prepend the line:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

- I haven't figured out how to make it XHTML 1.1 (maybe a newer
  version of NW's DocBook-XSL stylesheets?)

- Should I do this prepending myself?  I don't know how to do it
  automatically (why doesn't the XSLT do this?) but it wouldn't be too
  hard to make a shell script that does it for each file.

  for x in *.html ; do cat HTML-DOCTYPE $x > tmp ; mv tmp $x ; done
  rm -f tmp

  (with the line above in the file HTML-DOCTYPE)

- At least, I think it does.  I've only tried adding this line to one
  file.  I assume the other files don't do anything bad.

- Maybe I should add an HTML-validation rule to the Makefile.  That
  does seem in the spirit of automated testing of everything.  Is
  there an independent program I can use, or can I use the XML tools I
  already have, or can I do it easily (and quickly) over the web?
