files in the user's home folder should be *organized*, and logically
named.  it should be possible for somebody who doesn't know corina to
figure out what can be copied, what can be deleted, and generally
what's what.

all of the files should live in a corina folder, in the proper place
for such a folder on the native system.  that means:

- Linux: ~/.corina/
- Windows*: ~/Corina Support Files/
- Mac: ~/Library/Application Support(?)/Corina/

(*Windows: there's no real home folder, ~, on windows, though there
are a bunch of home folders which are nearly always in the same
folder.  that is, on the mac you have /Users/joe/, which is $HOME; on
windows you get .../joe/Pictures, .../joe/Media, .../joe/Desktop, and
so forth, but there's no way to get at .../joe/ directly (java fakes
it by taking the parent of .../joe/Desktop), because windows lets your
administrator put "Pictures", "Media", "Desktop", etc. all in
completely different places, on different disks, so there isn't even a
guaranteed common-parent-directory.  solution: i'll probably have to
find some place like .../joe/Library/, or whatever they call it.)

(*mac: i don't remember what the apps folder in here is called; look
it up.)

(*linux: ~/.corina/ is what it would be on proprietary unix systems
circa 1985.  some modern unix-based systems, like nextstep, actually
give the user a nice filesystem, so you don't have 200 dot files in
your home directory.  if you're using gnome or kde, this is true, but
it's different for each.  until the gnome/kde guys stop their nonsense
and work together, i'll stick to ~/.corina/)

files in the "Corina User Data" folder should be logically named, so
users can figure out what they are without consulting a manual.

Corina User Data
	Preferences -- these are simple things only
	Recent Files ("History"?) (separate from Preferences?  yeah.)
	Map Cache -- but isn't /tmp better? yeah.
	Favorites -- a folder
		-- list all user favorites in here, one file per fav-list
		-- smart lists go here, too
		-- don't identify by filename alone -- case might be lost!
		-- (xml format?)
	Cache -- (a folder) -- cache part/all of the IMDB in here?
	IMDB Cache -- (a folder) -- keep .zips of IMDB in here?

there's no reason to use filename extensions for files in here.  it
will probably only lead to trouble.  extensions are designed to help
operating systems determine the type of a file, and these files are
one-of-a-kind.

based on this design, it should be fairly obvious that, for example:

-- you can delete the "Cache" folder to free up space, without
destroying any of your data
-- if your prefs get messed up, you can move the "Preferences" file
out of the way to get corina to start again.
-- if you want to copy your settings to a new computer, all you really
need to copy are "Preferences" and "Favorites"

that's good, but i can even do one better.  i can put a README file in
there, in case the user has no idea where to start.

the readme file should contain:
-- the name and home (url) of the program which created this folder
-- what the program does; what these files are used for (generally)
-- a link (url) to the manual, for more information
-- a statement saying that corina changes these files automatically,
   and you should never need to touch them yourself.
-- a statement saying how to get to the manual from inside corina
   (help->corina help)

the readme must be in a format readable anywhere.  the obvious choice
is text (ascii).  the only other possible choice is HTML, because it
can include a link to the manual directly, and every computer has a
web browser today.

the readme, unlike other files in this folder, must have an extension
(.txt or .html); the user must be able to double-click it to read it.
