when you hit cmd-E (or start a new crossdate), then click "run", it
always defaults to the first crossdate (F[1] x M[1] x Alg[1]).

but sometimes you don't want that.  for example, suppose you've got
F[1..10], M[1..10], and Alg[1,2,5], and you're looking at F[7] x M[8]
with Alg[2], and you decide you want to see what Alg[3] looks like.

with the current system, you'd have to:
-- press cmd-E
-- click the crossdate to add (this part is great!)
-- click "run"
-- click "next" 8x7x3 times (actually fewer than this, but not much)

what i'd prefer:
-- press cmd-E
-- click the crossdate to add (this part is great!)
-- ("start at: " already points to the last crossdate i was looking at)
-- click "run"

if i use the 3-popup interface, i'll need to handle events:
-- fixed-list insert: add item to fixed-popup; if dimmed, un-dim
-- fixed-list remove: remove item from fixed-popup; if was selected, select (next/prev?); if last one removed, only item becomes "no samples", dimmed
-- fixed-list re-order: re-order fixed-popup, keeping selected item the same
-- moving-list events: same as fixed-list events;
-- alg-check: add item to alg-popup; if dimmed, un-dim
-- alg-uncheck: remove item from alg-popup; if that was last one, only item should be "no algorithms", dimmed
