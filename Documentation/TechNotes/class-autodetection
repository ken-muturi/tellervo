perhaps corina should autodetect classes.  for example, look for every
class in the jar which implements Crossdate.  that way, if somebody
feels like adding a new crossdating algorithm, they can distribute it
and say "dump this in corina.jar", and it'll automatically find it.

cons:
- everybody's corina.jar is different
- it's harder to get inside a .jar
- when they upgrade, it'll disappear
- if they think they can open corina.jar, they could mess other things up
- ...

so maybe it's not such a great idea.
