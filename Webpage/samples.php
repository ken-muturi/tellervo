<h4>Sampling guidelines</h4>

<p>If you are interested in submitting archaeological samples for dendrochronological
analysis, please refer to our sampling guidelines.  These are available in: <a href="/manuals/howto-english.pdf">English</a>, <a href="/manuals/howto-german.pdf">German</a>, <a href="/manuals/howto-greek.pdf">Greek</a>, <a href="/manuals/howto-rumanian.pdf">Rumanian</a>, <a href="/manuals/howto-italian.pdf">Italian</a>, <a href="/manuals/howto-arabic.pdf">Arabic</a> and <a href="/manuals/howto-turkish.pdf">Turkish</a>.</p>

<p>Those of you sending samples from outside the USA should print out a copy of
our letter from the USDA regarding <a href="manuals/USDAImportLetter.pdf">wood importation</a>,
and attach this as a packing slip on the outside of the package. It isn't quite an importation permit, but
it may dissuade the customs people from tearing open the package and/or burning the contents!</p>
