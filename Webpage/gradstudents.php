<p><a href="personal/sturt.php">Sturt Manning</a> is very interested in new graduate students who would like to work in the area of dendrochronology (broadly defined) and especially in areas of interest to the Lab and its current research, or as complementary to these.</p>

<p>If you are interested, you must apply to be admitted to a Graduate Field at Cornell.  For more information see the <a href="http://www.gradschool.cornell.edu/index.php">Graduate School</a> website.</p>

<p>Sturt is a member of the following Graduate Fields at Cornell:<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gradschool.cornell.edu/fields.php?a=4&id=97">Archaeology</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gradschool.cornell.edu/fields.php?a=3&id=03">Classics</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gradschool.cornell.edu/fields.php?a=4&id=30">Geological Sciences</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gradschool.cornell.edu/fields.php?a=4&id=10">History of Art and Archaeology</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gradschool.cornell.edu/fields.php?a=3&id=11">Medieval Studies</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Thus a prospective dendrochronology, dendroarchaeology, dendrochemistry, dendroclimatology graduate student wanting to work with Sturt in the Lab should look to apply to one of these fields.  Possibilities exist via other fields also - admitted students in other fields wanting to work in dendrochronology are welcome to contact Sturt to discuss.</p>
