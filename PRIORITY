======================================================================

STUFF I NEED TO DO BEFORE SHIPPING ANYTHING:

- fix undo/redo, so even if undo/redo don't work, it won't fail

- font
	-- use UIManager -- in startup, after prefs loading, before any swing calls
		-- also: add prefsListener for corina.menubar.font, which calls UIManager, as above
	-- (get rid of all the special font crap in ui.Builder -- corina.menubar.font)
	-- requires restart, probably, unless you do the l&f-repacking mambo.

- fix prefs
	-- it needs to start up without errors
	-- (get rid of jdisclosuretriangle)
	-- get rid of "try again" dialog  (what to do?  just log it.)
	-- use file "Corina Preferences" (non-unix)
	-- font chooser is missing
	-- implement "use which file chooser", or get rid of it

- broken:
	- indexing (undo postedit) -- just disable all undo/redo for now
	- new atlas (if no sitedb)
	- browse (if no sitedb; Site.getSite() called, NPE in Browser.java:199)

- need:
	-- on startup, a "wizard" which asks you where your data is?  (or just pick something nice, for default)
	-- if no sitedb file, make one, or (better) live without one.

- cvs
	- check in everything
	- tag it (with what?)
	- make sure you can cvs update, make all

- web page
	- upload current (cvs) version to web page

======================================================================

STUFF I WANT TO DO BEFORE SHIPPING 1.0:

- add mnemonics to main menubar

- do windows swing fonts obey windows, on 1.4.x?  if so, get rid of corina.menubar.font entirely.

- get rid of any other libs i don't really need...

- fix prefs
	-- clean up prefs dialog layout

- help
	- jump to correct page; need custom indexing?
	- use XSLT for making html-chunked manual
	- help works exactly once -- why?

- editor
	- disable "graph elements", "bargraph elements" if no elements
	- make popup look like a popup
	- add "list..." after species entry blank
	- make "comments" line up with top of box
	- keep track of open windows, so (for example) recent->x just brings x's window to front, if open
	- reconcile: make window title "Find Other Reading", button = "OK" (is that possible?)
	- dim sum->remove if there isn't an element selected (or move it to the elements tab)
	- get rid of "also redate all elements" entirely
	- site->*, can't find site: tell user how to set it!
	- export: popup shouldn't span entire width

- graph
	- "save as" dialog shows only type ".plot" in popup
	- add "type" menu which lets you pick Normal / Bargraph (or just put it under View?)
	- dragging samples doesn't work very well
	- if you try to drag, but miss, keep updating the bar, so you know you've missed

	- get printing working (multiple pages, white background, labels)
	- get svg-export working (white background, labels?, compress?)

- file chooser
	- add type ".plot" to popup
	- graph files shouldn't be "not a dendro data file" in the preview

- browser
	- FTP, folder, hotlist sources
	- summary uses |-delimited text files

- makefile
	- clean up libs
	- only compile once
	- use jikes

- web page
	- add instructions for downloading and building source
	- put my name on "home"
	- put last-mod on "features"
	- need better icon!
	- get rid of most of style.css?
	- make sure everything validates

- make or find a merge-jar util, or jar-in-jar (aleph?), so i can ship exactly 1 jar

======================================================================

STUFF I WANT TO DO ... EVENTUALLY:

- help system
	-- see freeciv gtk client -- it has, perhaps, the perfect help client

- add icons to recent-> menu, so you can tell at a glance if it's a sample/sum, graph, or crossdate

======================================================================

RESOLVED:

-- crimson is actually included with java1.4
	-- simply remove it, but leave it in the Manifest, and include a download on the web page
	-- users can run corina on 1.4 standalone, or on 1.3 if they put crimson.jar in the same folder!

- get rid of unused libraries
	-- batik is only used by graph/GraphWindow and map/Snapshot -- disable
		-- i only need to disable the front-end
		-- (later, i can choose to make it an optional download, or jar-merge batik.jar)
