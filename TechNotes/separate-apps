concept: separate apps is ok!

how to distribute?
-- win32: .zip file
-- linux: .tar.gz file
-- mac: disk image

what apps will i have?
-- corina (corina.jar)
-- atlas (atlas.jar)

won't they have common code?  yup: atlas will use (depend on) corina.jar.

what about the app-running issues on win32/linux?
