how browser indexing should work:

one sample selected:
-- select a sample, "x.raw"
-- right-click, Index... (or Manip->Index...)
-- the indexing dialog appears
-- (can click "graph" now to preview)
-- pick an index, click "Index"
-- the dialog goes away, a new file "x.ind" appears
-- (if you select "undo index x.raw" now, the new x.ind disappears
-- (if that file already exists, give choice: Replace, New File (like "x #2.ind"), Cancel)

more than one sample selected:
-- select samples, "x1.raw" and "x2.raw"
-- right-click, Index... (or Manip->Index...)
-- a different indexing dialog appears:

   You're trying to index many samples at once.
   You'll have to use the same algorithm(?) for all of them(??why?).

   Method: [ Exponential  (v) ]

                                  (Cancel) ((Index))
-- (can click "graph" now to preview -- previews all samples, all indexes)
-- pick an index, click "Index".
-- the dialog goes away, new files "x1.ind", "x2.ind" appear
-- (if you select "undo index 2 samples" now, the new x1.ind, x2.ind disappear)
-- (if one/more already exists, give choice: Replace/New File/Cancel -- for each one?? -- table?)

future:
-- indexes won't be separate from raw files
-- instead of applying an index to a file, and getting another file, it's a hint
-- you have a raw file, plus instructions on how to index it
-- when you index a file, you just change the "index-method" field to a new value
