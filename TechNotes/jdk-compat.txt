I like their philosophy about Java version compatibility:

(The current version, and the one before it.  While 1.4 is the current
release, it'll work with 1.3 and newer; when 1.5 is released, it'll
work with 1.4 and newer.)

Since I already target 1.3 (and not 1.2), this is simply putting this
policy in writing.
