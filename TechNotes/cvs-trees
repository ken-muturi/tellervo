i should have 3 independent (mostly) cvs trees:
-- corina
-- corina-manual
-- corina-website
(or maybe: program, manual, website)

program = [Libs, Src, Technotes, Makefile]
manual = [Manual, stuff in Libs needed for docbook processing, part of Makefile]
website = [Website, part of Makefile]

interconnections:
-- program needs manual: it includes all of the HTML in the program itself
-- website needs manual: it includes all of the HTML, plus PDF, etc.
-- website needs program: it includes binary and source downloads
