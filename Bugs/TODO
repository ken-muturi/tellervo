To do:
-- extract all external programs/libraries from the tree; they should be drop-ins.  If you want to use a newer version of FOP, download it, and plop it in.  (Also, the CVS tree can be much smaller.)
-- generate makefile rules for downloading them?
-- make a list of tools needed to build corina, for non-linux users: make, wc, echo, find, tail, grep
-- print error message if user tries to findbugs with <1.4 (how?) -- hopefully before compiling everything
-- toplevel should contain: Source/, README.txt, COPYING.txt, Licenses(?), Makefile
	-- manual project should contain: pretty much the same thing (DocBook/ -> Source/)
	-- webpage project should contain: pretty much the same thing (??)
	-- dependencies: webpage depends-on manual, program; program depends-on manual.
-- libraries/tools i need:
	-- crimson
	-- batik -- batik-dom (79 KB), batik-svggen (162 KB)
 	-- log4j?
	-- javahelp?
	-- junit
	-- docbook-xml (DTDs)
	-- docbook-xslt (stylesheets)
	-- avalon?
	-- bcel?
	-- jini?
	-- saxon?
	-- xalan?
	-- some png encoding program?
-- instead of Libraries folder, make a Utilities folder
	-- it holds things like FOP, junit, etc.
	-- in CVS, it has just 2 things: README, and Makefile
	-- the readme says what belongs here, and by what names
	-- the makefile has rules for downloading things automatically
	-- for example, batik.jar -- either link batik.jar to your system's batik, or use the makefile (make batik?) to download the latest version
